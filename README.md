# alien-mario
A procedurally generated 2D platformer in the style of classic Mario games

Using code based on Colton Ogden's repository (http://github.com/games50/), these edits add features and a level structure to the game. The finished product can be viewed at the following link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=datUcs68ESM

Added features include:
  - A level structure using flags to transport players to the beginning of a new level
  - Persistent score between levels
  - Key and lock blocks that spawn the goal post
  - Edited procedural generation to ensure player character survives original spawn-in
